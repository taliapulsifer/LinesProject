I completed the first half of the bonus question. The lines slowly fade to black and then stay at that color.
I did not finish the second half of the bonus question. 
The lines use 3D noise to generate color and angle. I used lerp to change the color of the lines to black over time.

I seperated the bulk of my code into a seperate function moveLines() and called that function inside of draw().
